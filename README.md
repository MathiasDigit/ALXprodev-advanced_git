# Git-Flow Overview

Git-Flow is a branching model for Git, proposed by **Vincent Driessen**, that helps developers manage features, releases, and hotfixes in a **consistent and scalable** way. It introduces well-defined roles for branches and helps teams coordinate code changes more effectively.

> Git-Flow is particularly beneficial for **large-scale projects** where multiple developers work simultaneously on various aspects of the codebase.

## üß± Branch Types in Git-Flow

Git-Flow revolves around **five primary branch types**:

| Branch Type        | Purpose                                       |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `main` (or `master`) | Production-ready code                        |
| `develop`          | Ongoing development                          |
| `feature/*`        | New features in progress                     |
| `release/*`        | Preparation for production releases          |
| `hotfix/*`         | Critical bug fixes on the main branch        |

## üéØ Relevance in the Development Process

Git-Flow improves:

- **Code organization** by clearly separating development stages
- **Team collaboration** through structured branching and merging workflows
- **Code stability** by allowing features to be tested and integrated before reaching production
- **Release management** by isolating release-specific tasks

It is widely adopted in **Agile** and **CI/CD environments**, ensuring:

- Seamless integration and deployment pipelines
- Fewer merge conflicts and regression bugs

## üéì Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, learners should be able to:

- Understand the **purpose and structure** of Git-Flow
- Identify the **different branch types** and their roles
- Apply Git-Flow in **real-world collaborative projects**
- Manage **features, hotfixes, and release cycles** using Git best practices

---

## ‚úÖ Learning Outcomes

Learners will be able to:

- Explain how Git-Flow helps manage **large codebases and team contributions**
- Create and manage branches following the **Git-Flow model**
- Use Git commands to initiate **features, releases, and hotfixes**
- Integrate Git-Flow into **CI/CD pipelines** for automated testing and deployments

## üöÄ Git-Flow Best Practices

| Best Practice              | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Start with `develop`**     | Always branch off from `develop` for new features, not `main`             |
| **Feature Isolation**        | Keep each feature in its own branch to reduce merge conflicts             |
| **Merge via Pull Requests**  | Use pull/merge requests to ensure code review before merging              |
| **Keep `main` clean**        | Only production-ready code should go into `main`. Never push untested code |
| **Tag Releases**            | Use Git tags on `main` to mark official release points                    |
| **Use `hotfix/*`**          | Apply emergency fixes directly on `main` via a `hotfix/` branch           |
| **Document your workflow**  | Keep documentation updated in the `README` or internal wiki               |

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Git-Flow Commands

```bash
git flow init                     # Initialize Git-Flow
git flow feature start <name>    # Start a new feature branch
git flow feature finish <name>   # Finish feature and merge into develop
git flow release start <x.x.x>   # Start a release branch
git flow release finish <x.x.x>  # Merge release into main and develop
git flow hotfix start <x.x.x>    # Start a hotfix branch
git flow hotfix finish <x.x.x>   # Finish hotfix and merge into main & develop
```

> üß© _Note_: To use these commands, install the [git-flow extension](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) or use manual branching following the same principles.
